    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Early life
    </h4>
    <p>
        I began my life at the tender age of 0. At this time I had no knowledge of reading, writing or mathematics. As I am sure you can understand this meant that life was very difficult for me. I was extrmely lucky to be born to a family where education was a priority and I was enrolled into a local primary school to work on the basics of life. I excelled particularly at reading and developed a love for fiction, after recieving the Harry Potter collection as a gift from my mother. I expect I have read them all through at least 5 times! After working on literature and numeracy I was sent to sit the 11+ exam. It was an exam to decide my academic fate and still is used to sort children from across the UK today. I was very aware that it was not a test to be taken lightly. I was fortunate in that I had gained entry to a secondary school and could continue with my education.

    <h4>
        Secondary school
    </h4>
    <p>
        To my surprise, I was expected to learn the basics of humanities and science at secondary school. I excelled at biology, but found chemistry particularly difficult. I was not a popular individual, but I had friends which I was greatful for. Often we would visit each other's class rooms to play cards or discuss last night's television. I found that my love for reading was recognised and I started my first volunteering position in the school bookshop. I soon came to realise that the slow hands of time had pushed me towards my GCSEs with a relentless force. I sat the exams with significant worry, under no illusions about how important they were.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Sixth Form
    </h4>
    <p>
        I had done it, I had secured sixth form at my school and I was thrilled with the result. I think I really came into my own at this time and started to understand myself a little better. It was during this time that I was promoteed to assisting in running the school bookshop and a 200 year old science society. Before I had chance to catch my breath however I was thrust into completing my A-Levels and choosing a career path. I had initally wanted to be a doctor. It seemed reasonable given my love for science and desire to help the community. However I had not mastered the technique of self study. I paid for it with my grades. This was a crisis for my younger self desite recieving an offer to study Neuroscience at Nottingham University. However I had a back up plan. Along side the usual UCAS procees I applied for an apprenciship and was granted the opportunity to work at the prestigious firm Deloitte. I now had a choice to make
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Resit my A-Levels and spend another year doing so</li>
        <li>Attend Nottingham with the hope studying Medicine as a Graduate</li>
        <li>Become an accountant</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I became an accountant and moved to London.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Deloitte
    </h4>
    <p>
        I never really wanted to be an accountant, in fact I had explicitly promised myself that I wouldn't become one after visiting the parent of a friend in her office. It was deathly silent and boring. I was however wrong about the latter. I started my career at a tax legislation boot camp well beyond the level of the Sixth Form student. No idea what I was doing I had to guess, irritate seniors and research the meanings of entire paragraps. Somehow I made it to the end and started my career at Athene Place. As the youngest person in the office I was often the last to recieve any work, but set about making my bones.

        I worked on a number of interesting projects advising FTSE 100 companies in ensuring that they were as tax efficient as possible. Beyond this we also created technical solutions. A favourite of mine being the creation of a technical tool to scan through an excel document and seperate items into various 'buckets' of classification. Watching the tool go from ideation to market delivery sparked my own idea. Reading the news one morning I came across the story of a crowd funding project worth $5m that had crashed and burned. After a little digging it became clear that the individuals who had squandered investors money were not held accountable or vetted for cometency in the busnuiss world. I proposed a solution. A large firm like my own could provide expertise to these platforms and investors by performing due dilligence on the ideas and the project members. This would help ensure that projects were more likely to get off the ground and become a success. The idea was taken on by a senior partner and developed into a new service.

        During a confrence on day I spoke to a gentleman interested in tax advise. I asked for his details and sat on the phone with a director in my department. The phone rang out and we tried him again, unfortunatly it was a dead end, however I became close to the director and worked for him on a number of projects. It slowly dawned on me that I was working with my future self, a director in tax. I knew that was not the direction I wanted my career to go. I secured a job with EY and handed in my resignation.

    <h4>
        EY
    </h4>
    <p>
        Working at EY as a Financial Management Associate was the most difficult job I have had. Working with the most senior people in the firm, there was no margin for error ensuring that all projects in the Banking and Actuarial space were profitable. Initially I found it difficult as they refused to fund my ACA exams, going back on their word during my interview. However the opportunity was too valuable to give up and I scraped by determined to qualify, come hell or high water. Help came in the form of my cousillor who backed me up to the hilt in terms of petittioning EY to fund me. Without his help, I would never have managed to finish my qualification. I called my mum on the day of my qualification, voice shaking and told her that I qualified. The sun shone down and my work of the last 4 years came to fruition. I entered the coveted ranks of the ICAEW.

    <p>
        My first job as a qualified accountant was working with an Asset Management firm in the West End of London. It was an exciting experience using my skills to help bring the firm into the modern world. I had the opportunity to work as part of a 5 person team, each of us with different skill sets, myself with the accounting knowledge, a data visualisation specialist, a developer and a member of the internal finance team. Together we picked apart data hidden in excel sheets all the way back to the 80's and helped the firm understand what made it as successful as it was. Looking back across assets including shopping centres, wind turbines and busnuiss parks helped us understand the deals process from start to finish and inform the busnuiss on how to maximise its profits. In addition to this we also provided them with a heat map that would cut the data to provide insights easily. It was a hugely rewarding experience where I learnt how to lead a team as well as how useful my skill set as an accountant could be.
